# Nieva-Async-Learning-Task-Cellular-Automata

The Lookup Table implemented for this Cellular Automata model was taken from the powerpoint presentation from this class' Cellular Automata slides (Page 27 - Elementary CA 30) and implemented in NetLogo.

The first row is generated randomly, then the rest of the rows are generated following the look-up table.

CA 30 is one of the 256 Elementary CAS (256 different ways of filling out a look-up table). This specific CA is actually very famous due to the model possessing very complex, seemingly-random behaviors even though the look-up table is simple at a glance. This model is elusive that even Wolfram, himself, set a 30,000$ bounty on the first person/team to answer three questions he has about the Elementary CA model (Found here: https://www.rule30prize.org/)
